#### DAISY

Huh.

#### ELIAS

Something wrong, Detective?

#### DAISY

How many tape recorders you got?

#### ELIAS

Can't say I'm entirely sure. We have all sorts of old equipment in storage, I think. You wish to use it for the interviews?

#### DAISY

Probably not.

#### ELIAS

And you're sure you want to do it in here? We haven't had a chance to properly clean it.

#### DAISY

##### [PAPER RUSTLES]

Won't take long.

#### ELIAS

If you say so. I warn you, some of my people have a tendency to... ramble.

#### DAISY

I just need to know where he is.

#### ELIAS

As you wish. Who do you want first?

#### DAISY

Don't care.

#### ELIAS

Right you are. You'll be alright on your own for a minute?

#### DAISY

_[Snort]_ That a joke?

#### ELIAS

Some people find this place unsettling.

#### DAISY

Mr. Bouchard, I'm not the one who needs to be scared.

##### [DOOR OPENS]

#### ELIAS

Whatever you say, Detective.

##### [MUSIC FADES AWAY]
