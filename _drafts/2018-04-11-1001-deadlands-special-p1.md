hi everyone Alex here with a couple of

things to mention ahead of today's

episode firstly I get to announce the

winners of our first writing competition

we had an enormous number of strong

entries and selecting just two for us to

produce was not easy that said after a

lot of discussion we did come down on

two winners so congratulations to

melissa mason for paint and Elizabeth

Richardson for Lucid both of your

stories are in production as we speak

and we will be releasing them as special

episodes in the mid-season break next

I'm giving a quick introduction to

today's episode as many of you are

already aware the Magnus archives is not

the only podcast that rustic world

produces one of the other shows we make

is called rusty quill gaming a podcast

where we get comedians and performers

together to play dramatized roleplay

games when we first launched the Magnus

archives we actually got Jonathan Sims

to write us a two-part horror special

for Halloween and today we'll be sharing

the first part of that with you you

might even recognize a few other

familiar voices though you may not

recognize that awful American accents

the second part of the game will be

available here next week in the meantime

though why not check out rusty core

gaming on iTunes or whatever service you

already use for the Magness archives

that's all for now thanks for bearing

with us in the season break and we hope

[Music]

welcome to rusty quill gaming Halloween

special it's pretty speak how spooky

dude beginners multiply that by fear we

are going to be doing a two-part

Halloween special this time gmt-- by me

Johnny Simms writes our host of the

Magnus archives and in my own time

just as bigger gaming nerd as Alex and

with me and Ben Meredith and the

entirely silent ghost of Lydian it is

what's that Lydia message is only we can

hear I'm not saying that on air so we

will not be conveying or repeating

anything the ghost of Lydia Nicholas

says but she is here with us in spirit

right so we are going to be playing

Deadlands

which is a western horror now you will

notice that in this the first of the two

episodes it's significantly more Western

and in the next one it will be

significantly more horror so if you're

expecting a spooks this time instead try

to enjoy the American accents Deadlands

is run on the savage world system both

the setting and the system are produced

by pinnacle publishing who are are

they're just great so the savage world

system you have your five main

attributes agility smarts spirit

strength and vigor moving thinking

feeling punching and getting punched can

you punch someone in their spirit only

with words

then you also have skills which are

under those each of them have a die type

from a d4 to a d12 when you need to roll

one of them you roll that die type if

you get a 4 or above you've succeeded

because you're all super special

snowflakes called wild cards you have a

protagonist superpower which is you get

an extra d6 for everything and you take

the highest of the tube you do not add

them together it also means that will

start to melt by part 2 of this yes you

also have little poker chips which you

can use to re-roll dice now there is

quite a complicated combat system it is

fast but not fast enough for a short

two-parter so for the most part if there

is combat if monsters are attacking you

I will probably say something like roll

your shooting roll you're fighting you

will do so and then I will tell you you

want to make a shoot make another shoot

so anyone listening who is very familiar

with the savage worlds system you will

probably notice quite quickly that are

what I'm running is not the savage world

system it is entirely a system of my own

whimsy the year is 1880 and history is

not our own the Battle of Gettysburg at

the height of the Civil War in 1863

something happened something went very

very wrong

lots of people say that the Dead

returned from the grave to feast on

their living companions

and that ghosts and spirits and all

sorts of demons and monsters emerged to

wreak havoc upon the American West all

of that obviously nonsense

totes butts or whatever reason for

perfectly normal mundane reasons the

Civil War just happens to have dragged

out for about 20 years it's currently

reached ceasefire and a stalemate

largely because just so many people are

dead in 1868 California fell into the

sea as it does it is now an area called

the great maze which is all sort of

waterways and mesas I was really really

hoping it was like ma I and it's just

overgrown and full of a wheat no no in

fact there's a massive famine problem

there so it should have been the great

maze for fighting

yep exactly and Metz applause shout out

for anyone who knows dead lands there is

still a massive famine problem because

this takes place in the early part of

1880 yeah I'm not gonna

explain that and people start eating

people that's the solution to all

famines

I mean like you yes but but that doesn't

matter

point is in the ruins of California a

new super fuel was discovered is it also

people are no no no any revelations

about it no just screams as though the

dead themselves are burning alive when

it's used for science reasons to be fair

uranium does the same is just motion

without encounter in their daily lives

so this has caused a real renaissance in

mad science steampunk man silence nice

Anse because it hasn't happened before

but there's lots of steampunk mad

science all powered by this super fuel

so anything from steam wagons to ray

guns to robots or brass and cogs and Shh

that sort of thing but none of that

matters to you guys

yay or no because you are all currently

hidden in a small camp in a valley in

Arizona a long way from any of this so

you were all in jail until very recently

now I'm gonna ask everyone to go around

and quickly introduce themselves and

their characters and listener I'd like

to talk to you for a second about James

we've waited fifty-three without the

entire rustic your gaming podcast was

actually just one massive an elaborate

intervention because you're so afraid of

interventions that it took this long to

get you here thanks now well James is

playing a character who's originally

conceived and written as Carlos Vasquez

an old Mexican gunslinger however James

despite wishing to play this character

has discovered that he cannot do so okay

the character of a lot of trains

nonsense voices stalk Ben yes will you

be playing I will be playing cigarillo

Lee who comes from Brooklyn because

that's the only American accent I can do

terribly the other ones I can't do it

all

I'm the greatest outlaw of this

country's ever seen I came from Brooklyn

make my make my fortune in sunny Arizona

didn't go so well it got held up on my

first job Alex

so I'm Nathaniel Fletcher I am a male

I'm not a thief but if I was a thief I'd

be a really good thief and I'm extremely

attractive everyone I know tells me so

even if you haven't heard it it's said a

lot and finally bring my name Zeke I

think that says it all really as a man

if you wear these uses it's reorder from

there so you like Groote

you wanna know anything else you can ask

I'm scared too

oh so fun little facts are most about

the carrots tree it's got a section here

which is alive yes or I assume no yes no

these are character sheets of my own

design and I felt that they needed to

take attain all information that could

be pertinent to the game so yes there is

a small section that details whether or

not you are currently alive it is

important information

I think he's a pretty impressive

character sheets created by Johnny and I

very much enjoy your minds

you've genuinely made in your mind mine

says appearance like if a barn could say

hey or slick hair slick moustache slick

everything really

Oh grizzled stubble to sharpen a knife

or not my face might be careful shaky

hands I've gotta freshen as yet unbeaten

face which bodes very well for me yeah

you won that's all about boar no thanks

mr. Zig sir

so you were all in jail in Phoenix

Arizona there's a variety of I do the

god of the American West for a variety

of crimes in fact I will let you detail

what crime will each of you in prison

for someone has too many questions he

didn't love the answers I gave him oh my

god for robbing the Train my mistake was

trying to rob the train itself rather

than the passengers get old get me

confused sometimes a time I I tried to

UM knock over a liquor store

unfortunately I forgot my gun I didn't

steal the dress I had the dress on me

and and the shop was changing stock you

were all in prison until a wanted bandit

that Carl

Sidebottom well who has worked

extensively with before by the name of

black jack Bronson Brooks he is neither

black his first name is not Jack but his

second name is Bronson but he just likes

the name black jack so he busted you out

and in the process the rest of you got

out as well and you fled and are now in

hiding in a gorge in Arizona because the

Rangers are currently looking for you

with black bronson all five like Jack

Bronson is currently out keeping an eye

before he's the lookout he's currently

the lookout yet he's not here he's

promised you all sorts of banditry

apparently his previous his previous

Posse got quite brutally gunned

down during a failed coach robbery

should you try robbing the coach I made

that mistake gotta rob the passengers

and he's essentially in the market for a

new gang and you guys are apparently it

so as it stands you're sat around a

small campfire in late afternoon it's

very warm

oh yeah I'm off any of you guys play

cards

no maybe pacifying a bit will be dinner

we've already had lunch so yeah okay so

and I found these cars I don't who's in

mine so I play black Jack's but it feels

like a like a misstep

so I mean poker poker poker poker poker

you look like a baby room so if everyone

wants to roll me gambling that will be

your gambling die a d6 your wild card

take the highest and if you don't have

that skill it's a d4 - - I've most roll

one dice being swindled by four No

so I'm going to say you lose $10 you

gain $2 yeah you gain $8 oh boy so

tonight is starting to fall when against

the skyline you see a horse and rider

approaching does it look like blackjack

it does look like laughter I don't flee

like whoa yeah no well who was thought

he's the crazy one growing Hope

dangerous young man we never know he

made Hitler 21 I will establish cold

or that multiple times before every time

I break you out of prison

every time we get a new member of the

gang go up there go crack help me old

material that's solid gold huh bunkies

oh they're too soon I don't know

I mean you remember the first time we

met and I had to explain it to you but

well you didn't understand till I called

myself

pontoon Bronson what a twist right see

two of saddles with a group of comedians

at me yeah Wow

what's the job I don't much care for

stands in my hot air hole like a

sniveling coward you here Bank up

customers tellers Volta can get a chance

about five miles ride to the east small

town Hensley gorge be watching a couple

of days sheriff came in two days ago

rode out now because rounds are the same

as normal shouldn't be back that way for

a while we should have a good few days

head start before any sort of posse

comes along any deputies around now that

I could see towns too small for a

marshal of itself

now obviously killing is not ideal but

we do what we have to well that sounds

easy should be nice simple job he'll

unfurl then all blueprints buddy is it

some paper that he's clearly been

sketching the outside of it looks like a

wordy little injury that's nervous all

that represents us all cops and trees

where we can retreat if necessary it

provides moderate cover it's not I need

just draw a tree call this judge with a

steeple that's because the church has a

steeple it's it's important all right I

mean I agree there's only one page

[Laughter]

from back east with three years Carl I

know how to draw a sketch with a

statement so as fascinating as that

cartography is it's a noble science oh

yeah

yes I am so be broaden the Oldman's oh

now I mean surely it's better to sort of

[Music]

[Laughter]

Wow it's fine it's it's gonna get us in

the second episode this is not gonna

make it all the more brutal it's getting

so much more for them to kill us

deliberately designed these characters

to be marriages but neither myself nor

the audience I believe you all got your

equipment from the prison John's weapon

is that sort of thing and question do we

know what happened to the dress I'm just

a dress I'm just asking oh the dress you

were stealing far as I'm aware it's

still back in Phoenix on topically in

the dress shop that's fine all right

money from this job you can buy as many

dresses as you want

not many dress it depends on the

expensive happiness of his taste you I

mean this this job that it isn't to do

with dresses and this was maybe like a

20 dress job look it okay fine sure so

so we we sneak in we sneak out I mean

that seems simple to be honest I worked

with your on a very direct sort of man

when I commit a crime what would your

preferred method

well I mean I'm I'm kind of looking here

like you say you've got it you've got a

cops I mean surely it's easier to just

sort of do you maybe notice robberies

James 4:4 blackjack seems a little bit

more impatient than he normally is you

know that as a standard rule he'd spend

a good couple of days planning a job

like this with the people who was going

to do it at the moment he seems to be

kind of pressing you to to just go for

it

you don't wanna go off into this sort of

thing half-cocked a normally at Ypres

para mmm I just it's a really good

window of opportunity as far as I can

see we've gotta go before the sheriff

comes back exactly and to be honest I

don't like this area

my boys were killed not a day's ride

from here the sooner we can get out get

further west into California with as

much money as we can carry happier on de

la cámara the direct jerk I say we go in

fast hard even quick you'll you'll need

a lookout from the cops I volunteer for

that I think that would go really well

um all right oh you know be there I'll

go and I eople okay yeah sure that's out

of sight as well I'll go there I'll hit

the steeple I'm gonna follow my rifle

not really how I mean I'll yell oh yeah

it'll be great

don't your mother think you're gonna

shoot to get attention more like shoot a

guy no no it's fine I'll yell and then

ZQ you're a strong guy you can come out

steeple smash cut to it is night on a

ridge overlooking Hensley George you can

see the squat brick building that is the

bank could you make me a stealth roll

are you going up a steep absolutely yes

it's a smiley face yoga's Roosevelt to

try and

hey get into the church my stealth is

formidable so we'll roll a v8 and a v6

and a d6 that's how the game was hello

Snake Eyes guys what auspicious

beginning to the right so the door to

the church is not locked it's a standard

white board Church if you imagine a

Western Church it's the picture of that

you open the door start sneaking you can

see the small staircase leading up as

the steeple behind you you come to hear

about the Lord

yes you look like I have needs a long

long long talk about the book of jokes

now you see Joe he's had enough time to

get up to the steeple let's go oh yeah

are you approaching on foot or horse

awesome yep you have of course I just

should say on my character sheet my

horse is called El Jefe

I like to point out because it's called

Sidebottom yes is now called Jet Li L

Jeffy short for Laurence Jeffy Jeff a

exactly my horse says be course his name

and they've got a name he's dangerous

his name is Bob okay lovely I just

wanted this put out he's a big horse is

it because you're a big person an old

horse would not do so much so you ride

hard to outside the bank the door is

currently closed jerk cover me I sling

my club over my back walk up to the

doors and give them a mighty kick mister

and problem and this point I'll add this

yourself like with wall to the back of

the side rails Gary yeah you we will

that six I should point out all the ice

in dead lands and savage world's explode

which means you roll them again if you

get the host number significantly less

excited about robust

9 9 yep you don't break the lock but you

do break the door around the law and not

the bit of door

the whole dog is basically just a lock

suspended in an empty space that then

cartoonishly falls to the floor the

other side is what looks like a solitary

bank worker currently counting out some

piles of money doing some paperwork he

has stopped and is looking at you stick

him up boys he sticks them up so when I

said boys are gestured for my two

companions to come into the room with me

three components I forgot

[Laughter]

so yeah his hands are well in the air

and you guys enter you are in the bank

blackjack strides in behind you

everything you can bonus to the vault

and the bank teller sort of points to a

large vault door behind him yes it's

very obvious

you'd think blackjack would have known

but apparently not he's he's winging it

blackjack do you know want to make him

open it no you're still here yeah do you

want you want to watch the horses maybe

what no I got this gun holds up herb

that looks a bit big feet yeah oh yeah

but I know is that the shooter I should

point out the signal me pretty stop the

points and click into this cigarette

Olli has a sharps big 50 which is the

largest gun in the dead land setting he

does not have the strength to use it

Oh Carl go with the tail and make sure

that vault gets open right here your

mother leading the teller along there

with his rifle George is poking along

that with the barrel of it right all

right just don't don't there ain't no

ain't no cause to be yeah what about you

phone

[Laughter]

Fuzzy's Idaho open the door

he's starting to open default are you

going to go and check on the horse

Zeke still looking at me no I've been

buying up the notes yonder on the

counter no I'm kind of hovering around

the front door kind of like I could go

see the horses but I'm not gonna okay

and at this point job found himself so

page on the sick of the test we made a

bet with God because God loves to gamble

yeah it's a point of my last sermon boy

aha God yeah loves soccer game about

r-spec does play dice not with cards or

dice or any other wicked simple thing

yeah but rather with the labs people a

father I see also yeah you know but it's

lethal thought it is I really think that

it is a noble thing it's climbing tall

live bakka side of it I mean yards

creation or of course God doesn't play

dice no I imagine imagine if God rolled

a snake who can imagine what sort of let

me draw it out effects I'd really like

to see God's creation from on high

could you facilitate that for me Father

what the steeple yeah was closed at six

after the surface Oh Oh father and such

a terrible sinner and son and I think

some perspective from maybe from on high

would grant me the chance to see the

error of stuff well I mean I'd love to

grant you your steeple base redemption

there son unfortunately

I ain't got the key caretaker doopty

he's probably in the saloon by now oh

that that's such a shame you know what

you've given me a lot to think about

father I know I'm only halfway through

the story and oh well father father I

wouldn't have reason to come back if you

finish now it's so and I have my own

follow-up parable fathers you'll excuse

me one second I have to pay a visit and

obviously in a house of cards had it be

inappropriate I just I just leave and

start heading towards the saloon all

right I'll see you Sunday probably

absolutely father yeah I'm just heading

to lesson ass young man

[Laughter]

so are you heading I'm heading straight

to the saloon to find the caretaker okay

meanwhile the teller has opened the

vault and there is a lot more money in

there than you'd expect from a from such

a small town bank Ewing's going so could

you make me a smart roll game just

generic smart yes this is this is what's

known as a common knowledge role that's

where you got smarts to see if you know

something I've rolled - twice - you have

no idea why there will be so much money

in there it's quite a common I mean we

have we have we have both Union and

Confederacy here I mean technically you

should mostly be Confederacy but I mean

this far west

how interesting

all right well I do thank you for not

shooting me oh no no no that would that

would violate your cross off okay I mean

we're not that happens I'm taking a TV

star to help you back it up he will do

it slowly and probably be stopping often

so actually make me an intimidation

oh yeah could've been one to take never

get my splash threat issues crunch

office yeah that's why I think that's

where the contamination comes her for

he'll he'll be bagging some money

you've now intimidated and threatened

him enough that as and when a Wells

Fargo agent says why did you help him

back up the money he can say he was

gonna shoot my crotch off yeah Zeke I'm

carrying the first pair of bags outside

of the pools or leaving the as it turns

round by scuttle out of the door like

yeah don't look at the horses

okay scary man song right you two then

are now inside of the saloon can I see

cigarillo well could you pay me now just

roll Tansy's good to explosions on my

Giro but yeah yeah you are both Jedi

10:10 brilliant six eyes are on a d6 on

a d6 then Yuri roll the six and edit

together because it explores so good and

exploring things and then a force or ten

so crowded town each other so intimately

each each four above your target is

called a reins and so if you succeed

with arrays then generally you get extra

good things and sometimes more racers do

good things sometimes it's just it's

just nice to know how well you've done

so yeah you see each other then your

eyes go back to the saloon as the doors

open and it's a very drunk man staggers

out supported by two relatively sobered

men the drunk man is wearing a very

shiny sheriff's style I immediately

stopped to a skidding halt look

incredibly panicked at cigarillo

immediately turn around and run back and

whilst going past the bank just sort of

gesture ha ha ha and then run back to

the church right okay Ben others scoot

back inside the door Zeke Zeke the

sheriff's here but he's really drunk

let's take a look I dumped the two bags

I'm carrying just inside the door and

poked my head out yet you can see the

sheriff staggering down from the saloon

to deftly supporting him so they do seem

to be deputies they are wearing less

shiny stars but they are deputies no no

he's just started violently throwing up

just in the street nice are the other

two supporting him and being something

until yes looking at the bank and

they're quite distracted folks they are

literally opposite you guys other side

of the street but right now they are not

looking at the smashed door of the bank

how far away is the other side of the

street about five yards it's quite a

quite a wide but a wide street the

commotion over hears the commotion of

cigarette only coming back into the bank

what's the problem the sheriff's just

come out the saloon he's got a couple of

Deputies yeah

Chris bond at this point mr. mr.

Fletcher runs past going come on car

kakaw does it alert the sheriff on his

deputies

it definitely alerts deputies I had a

gun I would shoot you Alex

yes you're obnoxiously loud kokorin has

caught the attention of the sheriff and

the deputies you see the smashed door

and yet they are starting to draw

weapons I'm gonna shoot one you're just

yours gonna lean out there and shoot all

right no shootin wrong I'm gonna do a

shooting role I get D ain't ya I'm quite

good at the shooting so I'm using the

shots big 50 yes I'm a - - yes

so that is a 4 a 4 that would normally

be a hit but it is night which is

another -2 for just being hard to see

too so one of the windows of the saloon

next to them is the gun box violently in

your hands

it's not actually the first time you've

shot it but you've never actually hit

anything with this gun so I'm gonna deal

out some very quick initiative cards so

faces are facing so it starts with

jokers ace king so that is spades are

the highest yeah yeah again savage world

casinos will notice that I'm not

sticking to a six second round this is

just a way of ordering the chaos okay so

I know that they're aware presumably

they are company there's been a big old

boom gunshot which is closer the bank or

the church you are equidistant between

the two I run to the church okay yelling

salvation salvation or free Jesus

salvation the old person has just locked

been looking the front door and will

turn oh you came back to tell me about

Jojo now I know some would deserve would

dismiss what I have to say is me not

mention not a father is mr. Sheriff or

rod there seems to be a bit of commotion

skip to the King of Diamonds stones is

clubs or clubs is the lowest okay right

so cold autumn is at the door of the

vault with the bank teller behind him

mhm so I think he just takes one pace

out he stands a door shut behind him and

pulls his rifle out okay do I have

enough time to then take a shot through

the window yes but I will be giving you

a minus two because it's a multi action

okay so you'll be a minus four in total

sure and I've got my special rifle which

in on this character sheet for

I says is called Consuela my trademark

Winchester 73 right so you get one so

it's a total of - three - you're a try

okay so d-10 at d6 and take 3 away from

the highest oh six - really roller six

six oh yeah six is explode that's the

ones that 7sus4 that is a hit

could you roll me your damage please

I'll say you hit one of the deputies

sure to d8 813 Toba and you we roll the

eight because yep gory gun murder the

first first gory rules he is here so

singularly okay going slightly pale cuz

not seeing somebody actually kill no

this is probably the first time you've

seen a headache this is the second this

is the second job I've been on them yes

let me try to knock over a liquor store

so I'll scramble into the banks I was

standing in the doorway and knock out

one of the panes and if I'm able to do

with the Maki action take a shot with my

pistol now and with my rifle we just

kind of over my back with it sure so

that was kings queens jack 10 yep

blackjack Ronson he's going for one of

the windows that does not open up onto

the streets still in the sort of teller

area and as he does so you can see he's

fiddling around with what looks like

some dynamite and he's going to try and

hurl it roughly just towards the sheriff

and his cohorts

he doesn't actually hit them but he gets

it into the middle of the street and

there is a boom various windows shatter

and just there's a lot of smoke and dust

and panic

so that was tens nine eight I call out

you lied to us blackjack ain't no lies

come on

they'll be down from now let's get this

cash out of here as quick as we can and

yeah you're so you're basically making

making tracks yeah I'm gonna I had two

bags or gonna pick it up and run to my

horse okay sir everyone before the

deputies are currently shaken so they'll

try and what I only want there to be one

deputy and the share of your are shaken

they'll be trying to recover their

senses unsuccessfully you can see a lot

more movement from the South saloon and

the sight of guns being drawn you don't

know if they're other deputies or just

armed towns folk because it's the Wild

West and more importantly it's a monster

filled Wild West so everyone has guns so

yeah it looks like you're very close to

being swarmed by a lot of angry whole

new round Jokers aces black Jack's a

nice black Jack's gun for his horse

kings queens jacks Jack Carl saw bottom

is now I think by this point

ease up against the window frame poised

over em and he's gonna take his time and

take a shot at their service okay you

ready you specifically want to kill it

kill the chef all right make me a cut

the head off the snake of law and order

in this town all right and that's how

long yes

t-turn plus forty six five is my chest

all bare so that's with minus one that

is a hit we drain your damage which is

to the eight

[Music]

five six is 1111 he's got shot he goes

down and don't know if he's dead but

he's certainly drunk and shots and on

the floor yeah he's probably not going

to be trying to tackle you okay yeah so

that's a jack

ten nine eight yep so yeah cigarillo Lee

is things are going badly tavern jail

Zeke and blackjack are going he's also

gonna go yep just run for it yeah yeah

anyone who's making a who's fleeing this

round I'm gonna let you go fine calm I

have some problems what's your what are

you want to - all right so the tavern

basically the windows of the saloon

explode we're done fire it looks like

it's being fired

pretty much blindly out of you guys Zeke

cigarillo and blackjack are not as

lighting a fire

and they've got incredible - it'll meet

you

there's a lot of exploding great Jesus

fire hoses right

and what is mr. fletcher doing so having

heard the gunfire mr. Fletcher is

proceeding to run to the church run past

the church while screaming oh praise

Jesus I'm saying oh oh

gracious I'm just not the book of Job

just I'm joking and Abbey Lyman

forgetting about my horse past the

church okay so everyone is fled I gonna

have cigarillo October's probably

supposedly left yeah I'm gonna as Angie

got my horse go it's time to go and then

I'm gonna unleash my rebel yell ability

right because Zeke has a ability called

rebel yell it's an edge that allows

you can do a terrifying war cry of the

Federal Army which can stun people

people go like oh my god I can't believe

he said that is that it's so not okay

normally there's issues with radius and

battles but I don't use a battle map so

just give me a bellow and then roll

intimidate I have no into oh I got loads

yes what's the opposite of not too well

given your in Arizona which this is a

pointless of war is your technique

Confederacy the saloon replies so I mean

this is great let's all have a let's all

have a big old gun I will let you leave

if you wish

yeah this brave I will probably I tell

you what I'll make you ask you to make

me an agility roll don't not get shot as

you leave sure yeah yeah six six and you

for being a bit shots it's the bitch

let's try every role using one of my own

you plan at it yes now fate chips or

pennies in service rules are a mechanic

for we rolling dice or normally soaking

wounds so if you get water you can avoid

getting wounded by its mental betting

I'm not really using the soaking thing

because as I say I'm massively simple

but if you're gonna bring all your

agility there to try not get dropped a

bit better yeah so what an eight an

eight then yes you managed to get on

your horse you managed to get on and

ride away with nary a bullet in your

engine to literally minutes of that cut

to the morning you've been all been

riding for hours well one of us hasn't

thinks he wasn't on a horse truly

everything wrong

has anyone I will say that you were all

running fleeing the same direction so

you will have come across be

pathetically fleeing I spit on you

[Laughter]

blackjack will pick you up if necessary

I'm at the front and I'm just direction

I'm so angry

okay yeah yeah sound too scared of leek

do I pick them up Oh where's the awesome

to beat the sings would be the last one

to catch them up so yeah cool so yeah

you've been riding now for of good few

hours there is a dust cloud behind you

you are being pursued could you all make

me write rolls no so it's D four minus

two plus D six because we're PCs so

that'll be the prevail mm-hmm six two

three three right brain is fine and the

money's on Michael James and Alex you're

going to be at minus one to all roles

and so you get a chance to sit down for

a while because you are very sad also

only a problem if I try and do anything

new smooth and cigarillo Lee has killed

his horse at which point and how he

feels very you tell me you've hardly

ever ridden before

you rode off like a matter you went like

you disappeared over the horizon so they

covered by side row with my thumb out

essentially yes you you have just

aggressively ridden your horse to death

because you don't know how horses were

curious and disappointed on leave but I

offer you a seat on the back of my horse

thanks mr. Theisen thank you I won't do

it again

god dammit all right it should have been

easy ain't no way that the sheriff

should have been there and the deputy

and the deputies goddammit and cold you

shut now there ain't no way they're

gonna leave off the chase now all right

this way and he starts riding off

following him you head down and you can

see quite a well-hidden Harry said sure

what's inviting another pot along with

us well I'm gonna saw not it's the only

place we got to hide right now I'm gonna

board in the brain you got it Jess what

do we do with the horses jerk well

should be space for him in there

okay we can eat them later don't listen

[Laughter]

don't listen to inject me and cold claps

his hands over Jeffy's ears you each the

cave it is dark the shadows they seem to

come right up to the end the Sun doesn't

seem to penetrate even a little bit

beyond the threshold it is a large cage

there is a lot of space in there you can

get the horses you probably wouldn't

want to start the fire in here because

it's a channel the smoke out quite

visibly it goes deep though it goes

quite a ways in you can't actually see

far how long we're gonna hold up here

jerk still I'm sure there don't do any

of us have a source of light in any way

you various view have matches and the

black jack has a few lanterns okay which

he will hand out actually in fact I'm

gonna say he has three lanterns he will

take one

he will give Zeke one and he will give

Carl one because fair enough that's

who's got the best stars

someone needs to be watching the glory

we came down oh there might be me uh

yeah probably I mean I don't trust this

man as far as I could throw it well

that's pretty far though

blackjack was that you sound like it

came from deep ok oh good adjusting wind

yeah probably just the wheel

sorry about that loves it's definitely

it's definitely not the wind we're all

in trouble we should flee immediately

all right sig row yeah yeah yeah you

watch the you watch the gourd sure call

you too I'll watch the horses no you and

Zeke let's go check out or I could

you're coming with us

oh oh that's fine black guy will hand

you each a lantern I get a lantern yes

and hey doll okay lead the way Zeke I am

right behind I have one hand on the back

of your neck and you are exactly one

arms-length in front of me then you're

mr. lay off to the mouth of the game we

go yep yeah sure sure thing it is dark

and you can see lacing through the walls

are small veins of a dark grey rock

speckled with white that you would

recognize as ghost rock it's about a

minute of walking the ground is

gradually going down it's a surprisingly

deep cave when it seems to split off

into two well now we know okay excellent

so it splits into two and there was

nothing here so we can go back you know

we want to take great I'll keep an eye

on Fletcher all right I'll go with

alright old apparently okay here we go

yep I've got a Lancet in one hand I've

brought my club okay blackjack will

gesture for you to proceed Alex Fletcher

knows enough not to try his luck and

proceeds really slowly being really

careful because that thinks he might die

soon after about a minute you come to

what looks like a roughly carved out

cabin you can't see any other exits from

it casting your light around it looks

like there a scrap

is over the wall what kind of scratches

name you notice wrong okay I notice is a

formidable for I'm good at stealing

things I'm not good at noticing them to

steal the six explodes mm-hmm to attend

to attend they are not fingernail

scratches they look like cause of some

sort the beam of your Lantern casts

around the room and you see what looks

like looks like a nest made of clothes

next to it is a pile of it's hard to

tell exactly it's leather okay we should

go die what is it called some stuff and

people and dead people and ten people

yeah definitely you sure have a look

yep I can see yep loads of loads of that

it's not turn to look at blackjack and

you can see that a little bit of his

face is sagging away from his eye

I dropped the lantern and immediately

flee the way I came and we'll end it

there Sookie

interestingly dropping the London isn't

even a tactical choice it just felt

right well thank you for that Johnny and

obviously people will be returning for

our next episode we the second

concluding part of this atrocious horror

thanks again for guessing and we will

see everyone next episode
